Simulation of Infinite matrix products of the matrices induced by our designed protocol.
Note that this analisis is valid for both the unicast and multicast version of the protocol.

Just run the file "run.m".

The function "IterationMatrix.m" is called every time a matrix is induced by the algorithm.

The results shows that the infinite products of matrices induced by the protocol always converges to the average matrix.

You can change the topology and the number of iterations.
