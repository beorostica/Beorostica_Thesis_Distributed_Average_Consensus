
This folder contains some simulation results of the protocols:
- Broadcast Gossip and
- Push Sum,
which do not correct packet losses. 

The Algorithms were simulated using an Hybrid Simulator in which delays are
not regarded, but the packet losses phenomena is presented. Only 6 agents
were used in the simulations.

To display the results, simply run the Matlab file "run.m".
This results are the same as the shown in the Thesis.

Logically, the folder "Data" contains the results for both protocols, which
contains all the results generated by the simulation which is not shown
in this folder.
